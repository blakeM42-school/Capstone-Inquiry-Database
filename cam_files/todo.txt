### TO_DO LIST ###
# [IN PROGRESS] 1. Figure out how to replace old graph with new graph [Ended up moving graphing options outside of graph window so input is entered beforehand]

#        2a. Add additional color palettes if need be
# [IN PROGRESS] 3. Add more graph types [Currently have Bar, Line, Scatter, Pie, & Histogram; Maybe add Box, Clustered Bar, Column, Area, Waterfall, Dot, etc.]
#               3a. Need to fix histogram graphing functionality
# [DONE] 4. Make buttons side by side instead of on top of each other [DONE]
# [IN PROGRESS] 5. Make plots interactive 
# 6. Possibly add line of best fit to scatterplot
# 7. Create function for scatterplot matrix
# 8. For graph types, when selecting graph type to process, only offer variables that would be graphable given graph type
# Need to ask stakeholder if she would prefer separate window containing graph or separate frame (i.e., general, audit, graph) containg graph & graphing options
