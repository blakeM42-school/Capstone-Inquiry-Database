### TO_DO LIST ###
# 1. [DONE] Figure out how to replace old graph with new graph [Ended up moving graphing options outside of graph window so input is entered beforehand]
# 2. [DONE] Add feature for changing color palette on graph if need be
# 3. [DONE] Add more graph types [Currently have Bar, Line, Scatter, Pie, & Histogram; Maybe add Box, Clustered Bar, Column, Area, Waterfall, Dot, etc.]
# 4. [DONE] Make buttons side by side instead of on top of each other

# 6. [DONE] Possibly add line of best fit to scatterplot
# 7. [DONE] Need to fix labels for legends in scatter and line plots
# 8. [DONE] Display value for each graph type (i.e., GPA of Applied Math Majors displayed on graph)

# Need to ask stakeholder if she would prefer separate window containing graph or separate frame (i.e., general, audit, graph) containg graph & graphing options
